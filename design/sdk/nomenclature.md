# Cosmos DB SQL library nomenclature

This page is intended to help document and align Cosmos DB SQL library nomenclature (aka naming stuff) across languages/implementations. Where things do not align for idiomatic purposes, this will also serve to document our reasons for not being consistent.

Currently this is focused on the vNext (v3 JS/Java/.NET, v4 Python) effort, but after those have GA'd it can serve as guidelines for future libraries.
